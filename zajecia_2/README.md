## Lesson 2 - classes and objects

### Exercise 1

You're a junior developer in company called Mex. Your first assignment
is to write a simple program that'll generate email addresses for new
employess. Email address should be built using following patern:
surname.name@mex.com

In case of people with the same surname and name, there should be a number
added to the name - ie. twain.mark@mex.com and twain.mark1@mex.com

It must be possible to provide a name and surname of new employes from
keyboard in console. Then program should print generated email address.

There're two approaches to hold information that can be used here:

* data about employess can be stored in the memory and will be gone
once program is closed
* data about employees can be stored in the text file
